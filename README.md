# Machine-learning Report
Enron was formed in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he developed a staff of executives that â€“ by the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting, thus were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.  This eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation. After the company's collapse happened, more than 6 lacs mail generated by its employees were made public.

**Objective**

The aim of this project is to identify the fraud based on the data available by employing machine learning algorithm. Machine learning is a great tool to use to make predictions by training and testing the data. This work has been organised as:
- Reading and investigatig the dataset
- Feature Selection
- Checking for Outliers
- Adding new features to the existing list
- Checking the accuracy using different algorithms
- Tuning the algorithm for the required precision and recall

## Reading and exploring the dataset: 
The dataset has records of 146 different persons with  21 different features. However, this is not a perfect dataset. There are many entries in the dataset whose records are missing and have been written as NaN. Despite that, we calculated the number of POIs (persons of interest) and total number comes out to be 18. I also looked at their salary side by side.

## Feature Selection
The features I decided to choose for my investigation includes **poi, salary, bonus, total_payments, loan_advances, to_messages, from_messages, from_poi_to_this_person, from_this_person_to_poi**

## Checking for outliers
- A salary versus bonus plot is created and we see that an outlier exists. On investigation, it was found to be 'TOTAL' value actually which has crept in the dataset due to human error. Removing this and replotting shows us that majority of the employees have a salary around 5 million US dollar but few have more who turn out to be the owners and CEO of Enron.
- In the second scatter plot, we check the relationship between the saalry and loan_advance which is the loan one takes from a bank. Surprisingly, there are people who have salary in excess of 100 million and yet have high loans to repay. For the dataset these are outliers but it also exposes that unethial practices were going on in conjuction with the banks. On searching, it turned out to be the CEO of the company, **LAY KENNETH L**.
- Third plot is in sync with second one, where we see the relationship between loan and total amount. **LAVORATO JOHN J**, **BHATNAGAR SANJAY**, **FREVERT MARK A** are the three pople who are identified as outliers here. These outliers are removed and cleaned dataset is created as well as the plots showing the beahvior.
